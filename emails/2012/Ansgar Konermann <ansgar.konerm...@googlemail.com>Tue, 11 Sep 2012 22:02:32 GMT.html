&gt; I find also such discussion interesting
&gt; it is always good to know what is existing arround and if some inputs may
&gt; drive to improve Maven itself.
&gt; The fact to know also why Maven is here is an important thing to better us
&gt; it.
&gt; This is especially what we did with Nicolas De loof in our French book few
&gt; years ago and readers loved a lot because they were able to understand why
&gt; some choices were done in maven ..
&gt;
&gt; About Gradle, I studied it and tries to use it but for now I'm always not
&gt; convinced about its ideology. I like to be free of my choices but I'm not
&gt; sure that it is always a good thing. Standardization may be seen as a
&gt; limitation but for whom ? For the team using it ? For people who will join
&gt; later the project and will find something known ? For the transversal team
&gt; in a company that will support dev teams ? Depending of the context, the
&gt; "enforced" standardisation may be a good thing. I'm sure that a gradle
&gt; build in experts hands may be magical but how often will it be the case
and
&gt; for how many times ?
&gt;
&gt; What is fun is that this debate Gradle vs Maven makes me think to the
&gt; debate Git vs SVN we have on the dev list.

Me too.

&gt; What do we prefer ? Something
&gt; powerful but perhaps to not put in all hands ? Or a common tool that is
&gt; just doing the job ?

A tool which makes it likely that we achieve our goals easily.

What are our goals?

* issue control about what people do with maven source code?

* ensure plugin users know where their feedback should be sent to or where
to get help? How can this be done without interfering with other goals?

* Make contributing as easy as possible? If so: who are our potential new
contributors? Which tools do they like to use?

* Learn about what our users need? What other ways of doing this could be
advantageous, besides jira?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it's useful to debate build tools and their builders or
&gt; &gt; &gt; tools on this list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe it is very useful. Many new users to maven don't fully
&gt; &gt; understand the problem maven tries to solve, and a discussion like this
one
&gt; &gt; will hopefully shed more light on why maven approaches the build
problem as
&gt; &gt; it does.
