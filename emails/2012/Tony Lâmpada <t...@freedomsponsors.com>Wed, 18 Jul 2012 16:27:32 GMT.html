Hi Benson,

thankings for bringing that subject up.

We have been giving a lot of thought into questions like

1) What problem-scenarios might arise when a lot of people starts using
FreedomSponsors?
2) And what would be the best way to address those problems?
3) How should FreedomSponsors evolve to best serve the open source
community?

And forking is one of our concerns as well. It surely fits (1)
We believe that, generally speaking, forking is a bad thing.

Please take a look at this "Feedback issue" (which is curently an
improvement under develeopment) --&gt;
http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/issue/7/add-two-checkboxes-to-the-offer-form-1-no-forking-2-require-release

We want to encourage sponsors to fund the original projects - so the "No
forking" checkbox will come checked by default in the "Sponsor Issue"
screen.
If the user unchecks it, a popup window will be displayed, explaining the
bad effects of forking, and maybe that decision should be reconsidered.

Hopefully what will happen is that most offers will have "no_forking =
true" on their acceptance criteria.
Developers then will have to actually get involved with the already
well-established OSS communities to have access to bounties.

If you have more thoughts regarding (1), (2) or (3), we're listening! :-)

Thanks
Tony L창mpada

&gt; The biggest danger is that projects will get funded that do not fit into
&gt; the strategic direction being followed by the ASF committers.
&gt; When the funded artifacts are turned over to the ASF team (assuming that
&gt; they are not doing the work) and they refuse to incorporate the changes
&gt; into an official release, there will be a fork in the project which will be
&gt; supported by the companies that paid for the enhancement.
&gt;
&gt; ASF will have to be very careful not to let egos interfere with good
&gt; long-term management.
&gt;
&gt; On the whole, this could be a good thing for ASF, if it is handled
&gt; properly.

&gt;&gt; Hi Benson
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Then I think that all will be well indeed.
&gt;&gt; Building that kind of relationship with ASF is very much aligned with our
&gt;&gt; goals.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Right now we're working on multiple fronts to improve our service and get
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; small scale operation going, so we can make the necessary tweaks to make
&gt;&gt; the model actually work.
&gt;&gt; When the time comes, I believe approaching ASF (and Codehaus, JBoss, etc)
&gt;&gt; will come very naturally. And donating part of what we get just makes a
&gt;&gt; lot
&gt;&gt; of sense (even if we were thinking as investors).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; FreedomSponsors is made by developers who love open source, and our main
&gt;&gt; goal is to serve the OSS community, while also being able to work on the
&gt;&gt; open source projects that we love ourselves!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But those are still dreams for the future. Now is the time for us to do
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; best we can to get there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So... Wish us luck! :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for getting involved!
&gt;&gt; Tony L창mpada
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; PS: Speaking of OSS, just as a side note: We are going to open source
&gt;&gt; FreedomSponsor's website code as well (there's some code cleanup we have
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; do first, though)

&gt;&gt;  It is extremely unlikely that the Foundation will be interested in any
&gt;&gt;&gt; participation except to gratefully accept any unrestricted donations
&gt;&gt;&gt; your organization might happen to make. If you want to state on your
&gt;&gt;&gt; website that you are going to donate something to the ASF when the
&gt;&gt;&gt; issue is an ASF project JIRA, and you conform the ASF trademark and
&gt;&gt;&gt; branding guidelines, I predict (speaking without wearing any official
&gt;&gt;&gt; ASF hat) that all will be well.
