&gt; This to me is the fatal flaw in ant and all tools like it. Ant allows the developer to
do whatever they like, and so they do, unnecessarily different to everyone else, and this
difference must be debugged, documented and learned, over and over again, wasting countless
hours and money.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; To understand maven one first has to understand discipline in software engineering, why
there is no value in solving a solved problem in a way that is different but no better than
solutions that have gone before. Why the best documentation is simply no documentation at
all. Why the gift of a repeatable build is priceless to the person who has to fix a bug under
stressful conditions.

Well said by Ron and Graham. 

With the knowledge as the person that wrote the "associated Maven build" (shameless plug ;)
and without disclosing anything, I think you can see based on it's dependencies that it's
not going away anytime soon.  There was a lot of resistance to it in the first place, to the
point that I was seriously asked a few times why the build couldn't be ported to Ant.  

What that says to me is there is a lot of organizational inertia around not doing the same
thing multiple ways.  In interviewing stakeholders, nobody was attached to Ant, they just
knew it's warts and how to get around.  It was a sunk cost.  Totally reasonable.  

Gradle not only allows the same thing to be done multiple ways (like Ant), but now you would
be introducing all of Gradle's multiple ways in it's own different way.  You'll have one paradigm
that is "hard" but can't and won't be removed, one that is almost universally deprecated (I
can't remember the last time I've seen a new project using it), and another that is some hybrid
of the two, but with completely different syntactic sugar.  Given the resistance to adding
one new build tool, adding a second for a total of three doesn't sound likely.

Also do not forget about plugin support necessary for target environments.  I did do the thought
experiment at the time why the build could (or should) not be rewritten in Ant (welcome to
the world of being a good contractor!), and the final reason Ant couldn't be used was target
product plugin support for Ant wasn't there.  If you dig into the plugin context that is available
when a plugin runs, one wouldn't seriously attempt to run Maven plugins in an Ant build. 
I theoretically could have ported the plugin(s) to Ant task(s), but one key vendor plugin
was proprietary.  This same problems will haunt you in Gradle until all vendors have equal
support for Gradle as they do for Maven.  

While I think I only wrote one plugin for that build, such internal plugins can be used in
builds across the company.  This is another reason to standardize on a single build environment.

This isn't to say that you won't need to do some plugin work to get your new build in robust
working order.  When I did the (now apparently missing) POC of it, I remember that there was
some issues that were not solvable with five minutes of Maven foo (and why I stopped working
on it).  But it wasn't weeks of work either.  

HTH, Brian
