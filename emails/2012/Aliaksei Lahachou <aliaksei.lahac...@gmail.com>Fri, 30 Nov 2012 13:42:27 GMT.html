Hello everyone,

I'm am against updating default version to 1.7. My favourite option would
be to use the lowest possible version of JDK and give a warning if version
is not specified explicitly (similar to what resources plugin does with
encoding). I would actually go as far as warning people if they explicitly
specify version 1.7. There are a lot of folks who think they are so great
using the newest versions, but it actually may cause problems.

We have a pretty big and old application which is currently developed and
run on JDK 1.6. There were issues with 1.7, but they were fixed. The real
problem is updating customers - there are about 300 different installations
supported by our teams. It's actually pretty difficult to get on customers
servers, for each you have to contact their IT and schedule a session and
downtime.

The problem is the following. Real life experience: I wanted to use Adobe
XMP core and luckily, it was in Maven central. But not so luckily, it was
compiled with JDK 1.7 (without any need) and JDK 1.6 refused to compile
with it. I had to get the sources, compile with JDK 1.6 and put it to our
local Nexus. If maven-compiler-plugin default version is updated to 1.7, I
expect more artifacts built for 1.7 without any need.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have never seen any java application fail just because I run the
&gt; &gt; version 7 VM. Even really old code still runs.
&gt;
&gt; A couple of Atlassian applications I work with in our department that
&gt; didn't run (fine) with Java 7:
&gt;
&gt; - JIRA &lt;= 5.1.x (5.2 was released ~3 weeks ago)
&gt; - Bamboo &lt;= 3.2.x (3.3 was released 11 october 2011)
&gt; - Confluence &lt;= 4.1.x (4.2 was released 10 april 2012)
&gt;
&gt; etc.
&gt; It took quite a long time for the manufacturer to implement the necessary
&gt; changes to let their products work with Java 7. JIRA for example wouldn't
&gt; even start correctly when using 1.7.* and instead threw lots of exceptions
&gt; in its log, whereas for at least Confluence 4.1.x there were some
&gt; workarounds to let it run with a JVM 7...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In our department we had a very old legacy application written by some
&gt; colleagues back in the days of Java 1.2 when the first Swing UI came out.
&gt; They told me they had lots of problems with former Swing UI bugs and
&gt; programmed workarounds to get the application finally work with Java 1.4.
&gt; These workarounds didn't work correct anymore with Java 5 (Swing bugs were
&gt; fixed?), i.e. the application's UI had some nice "features" a.k.a bugs :-o
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately they weren't given the time to fix them (you know, the usual
&gt; problems with sales that had other priorities...) so they had to stick
&gt; with Java 1.4 until ~2.5 years ago (!), until the application finally died
&gt; about one year ago. That's life...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
&gt; Thorsten
