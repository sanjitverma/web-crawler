One thing I would like to add to this discussion is that, in my
experience, a lot of "Maven users" don't understand that Maven is not
only about building but also about producing something that can be
consumed from a repository. One part of what we often call "Maven" is
the build tool, but a much more important part is having consumable
artifacts in a repo. So, IMHO, I doesn't really matter if you can
build something if it can't be consumed by other people. Doing
"clever" solutions like producing multiple artifacts from one Maven
project most often makes them hard (or even impossible) do consume
from a repo in a correct way.

But yes, documentation about this could be much better. But as someone
very correctly pointed out, there is very likely is a reason for the
lack of this. It's all open source and contributions are gladly
accepted. Even the Sonatype's book are open source (well, "Creative
Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, No Derivative Works 3.0 United
States license"). If you have suggestions, additions, or whatever,
file an enhancement ticket and it will be appreciated and most likely
added. Some people do this, but there is always more that can be done
and we can all participate.

&gt;&gt; Often the wrong foot is simply not knowing how much Maven does for your for free

is not obvious, we naively start trying to solve problems we do not have to.
&gt;
&gt; The way I describe this is by getting people to ask the right question:
&gt;
&gt; Wrong question: "How do I do X?"
&gt; Right question: "Does does maven do X?"
&gt;
&gt; Maven already knows how to do stuff. Find out how maven does it, and let maven get on
with the job. As soon as you want maven to work your way, and not maven's way, expect to have
loads of your time wasted, and the time of everyone after you too.
&gt;
&gt; The next thing is that maven isn't an alternative to ant, rather maven is an alternative
to ant's build.xml file. Or to put it another way, maven does what build.xml does. build.xml
gets written, rewritten and rewritten again for every single ant project, but there is only
one maven. I have to care how your build.xml is different to my build.xml, I have to document
how your build.xml is different to my build.xml, but if we both used maven, all this becomes
unnecessary, because there is only one maven.
