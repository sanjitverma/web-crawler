I am going inspect all the plugins

Thanks for the great suggestion

&gt; Hey Dan,
&gt;
&gt; I think I've seen my extension still fail a few times as well, but it
&gt; wasn't reproducible enough to debug for me. It is still a concurrency issue
&gt; amongst the other problems; so it could simply be something I assumed
&gt; thread-safe API actually isn't thread-safe at all. (Which opens another
&gt; interesting dimension of problems, should that be true...)
&gt; On the other hand, I decided to tackle the core problem in our build
&gt; instead: removing aggregating plugin executions from anything but the root
&gt; pom.
&gt;
&gt; It might be a lot of work, but given how these plugins resolve their
&gt; dependencies, it might be for the best. (Besides the fact that, if I recall
&gt; correctly, these kinds of plugins are described as aggregating data from
&gt; the entire project.)
&gt; For example, in our case the javadoc plugin (amongst others) had the
&gt; aggregate goals declared in the root pom, but - unfortunately - these goals
&gt; simply get inherited to all child poms as well (causing the mentioned
&gt; problems).
&gt;
&gt; What we did was simply run the help:effective-pom target on the projects
&gt; (randomly) failing in a concurrent build; and check for all the resulting
&gt; plugin executions whether or not that goal was an aggregate goal or not.
&gt; With the list of offending plugins ready, we removed those that were
&gt; configured wrongly by developers. The ones left, we configured with
&gt; "&lt;inherited&gt;false&lt;/inherited&gt;" in the plugin definition in the root pom;
&gt; which makes the plugin only configured and run on the parent.
&gt;
&gt; Actually working through the poms and fixing the offenders has made our
&gt; concurrent build 100% stable again. So while the extension does - in our
&gt; case, at least - certainly improve stability; it's still (unfortunately)
&gt; not a complete (easy) workaround.
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully this'll help you get your build stable again as well. Otherwise,
&gt; it'll be a waiting game until the issues I mentioned are picked up.

&gt;
&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; The way you describe it; this sounds like a problem I also encountered in
&gt; our (similar sized) project here.
&gt; I reported this here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5960,
&gt; which has been linked as related to
&gt; https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5750.
&gt;
&gt; Troubleshooting boiled down to running maven in debug mode; which might
&gt; be something you don't want to do.
&gt; In any case, I found that plugins running aggregate goals (e.g.
&gt; javadoc:aggregate) will resolve (compile) dependencies for _all_ projects
&gt; in the reactor. Running such a plugin in anything else than your root pom
&gt; might cause the random failures you have. (And having the plugin in your
&gt; root pom might also effectively include its configuration and execution in
&gt; child poms; which is "debuggable" using help:effective-pom.)
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully this helps you.
&gt;
&gt; - Fabian

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; My 150+ modules with multi-thread build randomly error out with something
&gt; like this
&gt;
&gt;   java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/LoggerFactory
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Have you encountered similar issue?  how do you troubleshoot?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am using maven 3.3.9 and latest compiler plugin
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
